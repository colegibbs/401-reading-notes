# Reading: Graphs

## The Graph Cheat Cheet

- Non-linear data structure that is a collection of nodes(verticles) connected by line segments(edges)
- Terms:
  - Vertex = Also called a node; data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
  - Edge = connection between two nodes
  - Neighbor = adjacent nodes or nodes that are connected by an edge
  - Degree = number of edges connected to the vertex
- undirected graph
  - edges does not move in a particular direction
- directed graph
  - also called a digraph
  - each edge has a direction from one node to another
- complete graphs
  - each node is connected to all other nodes
- connected graph
  - each node has at least one edge
  - a tree is a connected graph
- disconnected
  - a graph where one or more nodes have no edges or do not connect in some way to other nodes outside the island
- acyclic
  - a cycle is when a node can traverse back to itself
  - a graph without cycles
  - a directed acyclic graph also called DAG
  - tree
- cylic graph
  - a graph that has cycles
  - starts and ends at the same node
- adjacency matrix
  - way of representing a graph
  - each rown and column sum must add up to one if and edge exists there
  - sparse graph = few connections
  - dense graph = many connection
  - undirected graphs will be symmetric
- adjacency list
  - most common way of representation
  - linked list or list that has the targe node followed by the ones that are connected to it
  - if no connection then not on the list
- Weighted Graphs
  - numbers assigned to edges called weights
  - a weighted matrix is a representation like the adjacency matrix, but instead of using 1 when there is an edge you use the edge weight number
  - in a widthed adjacency list you just pair the targets node, connection node with the weight number of that edge connection
- traversal
  - like a tree
- breadth first traversal
  - started node specified when method is called
  - as you traverse add the node to a visited set to keep track of where you've been so you don't get into an infanite loop
  - closest to root out
- depth first
  - use a stack
- Real world Use!
  - GPS and Mapping
  - Driving Directions
  - Social Networks
  - Airline Traffic
  - Netflix uses graphs for suggestions
