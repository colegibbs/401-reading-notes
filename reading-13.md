# Reading 13: Linear Regressions

## [How to Run Linear Regression in Python](http://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)

- Scikit-learn is a tool used for machine learning
- import needed libraries
- .fit() fits a linear model
- .predict() predicts the why with the linear model
- fitting the linear model to one feature has high error value
- in reality you would not do a linear model on an entire dataset
- training data - to traing the model
- test data - to test the model
- visualize error with residual plots

## [Introduction to Simple Linear Regressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsVBBJRb9TE)

- regression anaylysis explores the realtionship between a quantitiative response variable and one or more explanatory variables
- simple linear is one
- multiple regression is many
- establishing the realationship between variables to predict hard to measure variables
- y is the variable being predicted
- x is variable being used to predict
- x is explanitory variable
- y is the response vairalbe
- can there be a lineral model is the question
- observed value of y vary
- the equation accounts for the variation of y
- Y = y-int + slope + error component
- estimate y int and slope
- use sample data to obtian the estimated regression line
- predicted line does not need error component
- least squares to esimate parameters
