- ceaser cipher was developed by ceaser an was one of the earlist encription techniques
- ways to crack the cypher
  - frequency analysis
    - the most common english letter is 'e' you can find the letter that occurs most frequently and assume it's e
  - Known plaintext
    - if you have part of it unencripted it's easier to crack the rest
  - Brute fource
    - if you try out every possible shift in the lettering you'll eventualy come across the correct one
- encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key
- decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key
- code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret by using a variety of clever techniques

## [Ceasar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

- Ceaser used this cipher when sending messages
- similar concepts inside of some more modern encryption techniques

## [Cryptography Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o)

- always will be vulnerable to attack
- cryptography is the most common form of computer security
- cipher encprys text
- substitution ciphers subs letters, vulnerable to frequency analysis
- permetiation cichers - read letters over a grid
- enigma was a cipher machine
- enigma rotor: swapped the letters in the enigma
- enigma used multiple rotors and could be takin out and put at differnt starts
- data encryption standard was one of the first software encryptors
- advanced encritpion standard uses much bigger keys and makes brute force attack mcuh harder
- key exchange - two computer agree on a key without sending any keys
- diffie helman is a one way mathematical function to get a key
- computers send parts of the key to eachother and then complete it on there own ends
- asymmetric and symmetric encryption
- lock icon means that encryption is used on the server
