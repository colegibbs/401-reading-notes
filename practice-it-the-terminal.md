# Practice It The Terminal
 
- I will use the ls -l 
- `ls fileName` give ls in file
- `~` shortcut for home
- everything is a file
- extensions in lunix don't matter b/c lunix looks inside the file to determine the extension
- Lunix is case sensitive
- avoid spaces in names of files and dir
  - if there are wrap it in quoes
- hidden files start with `.`
  - no special command to make a hidden file, just start it with `.`
- to find out docs about a command use `man <command>`
- to search a key word in docs command use `man <command> <searchkey>`
- once in docs:
  - `/<term>` to search a term
  - `n` for next item
- `rmdir` for removing directory
- `cp <source> <destination>` to copy a file
- `mv <source> <destination>` to move a file
- rename files with `mv`

I knew a lot of these commands already because I took code 101 - 301. It was really great to have a refresher course on all of the commands. I didn't know that options like `-a` were shorthand for more readable commands like `--all`.
