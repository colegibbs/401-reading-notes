## Emotional Intelligence Assessment

My results didn't suprise me for this assesment. I got 17 for self-awareness and self-management, 19 for social awarneess, and 15 for relationship managment. None of these scores are terible and none are great. I do have trouble with relationship management and managing time with people I have realtionships with. I'm getting better at this. I've been working on it for a while. I think that I can improve by keep doing what I am doing while aiming higher and higher.

## Assessing Bias

I got a 108 out of 120 for this assessment. This means that I scored highly which is great. I have lots of room to improve which is also great and exciting. I hope that as I move into the work force I will become more comformtable with topics that might make me feel uncomfortable or left out.
