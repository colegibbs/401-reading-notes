# Welcome to Cole's Page

Welcome visitors! My name is Cole Gibs I'd like to personally welcome you to my first Github page. Before many hours spent coding and my commitment to Code Fellows I was a Chemistry Student at a local college in the Seattle area. My first experince with coing was actually quite horrible. The first time I wrote a line of code was in a JavaScript class while I was in college. I found it difficult, stressful, and far too particular. However, for one reason or another, it stuck in my head. Shortly after my class ended I started learning some code online and found it extreamly enjoyable. This hobby took up more and more of my time until eventually the only logical way to move forward was to turn my hobby into a career. I'm excited to me sharing this page with you as well as my [Github Profile](https://github.com/colegibbs).
